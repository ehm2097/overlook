Proof of concept for an AngularJS application split into a framework part and a minimal specific part

AngularJS is a great framework, which provides a high flexibility of the applications one can build with. This flexibility comes with a cost however, which consists in the mix of standard and specific code required to implement most features. For instance, in order to create a basic table-shaped list, one needs to write code just to assure that heading and data columns match each other.

This project aims to losing functional flexibility with the benefit of implementing standardized features with minimum, lightweight code. Or at least, this is the idea, hence its "proof of concept" title.
